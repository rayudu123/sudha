VM vs Docker:

Virtual Machien : Previously we used VMS where its structure is like this--->Server-->HOst os-->Hypervisor-->Multiple OS--->bins/libs/APplications
Docker : Server--->Host os---> DOcker Image-->Docker Engine--->Multiples OS 

Major difference is again no need to install OS on each server Docker will share OS from image basic bin & lib files to run application.




server:
OS
vm --->LIb files / softwares/LB pool and DNs creation -->
A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).
 A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing. 





Need of physical servers are not required
images that contain everything needed to run them: code, runtime environment, libraries, and configuration. 
Images run in containers, which are discrete processes that take up only as many resources as any other executable.
It’s important to note that Docker containers don’t run in their own virtual machines, but share a Linux kernel. 
Compared to virtual machines, containers use less memory and less CPU.
Reducing setup time
Compatibilty issue resolved 



Advantages:
Consistent test environment for development and QA.
Cross-platform packages called images.
Isolation and encapsulation of application dependencies.
Ability to scale efficiently, easily, and in real time.
Enhances efficiency via easy reuse of images.

Version compatibilty:
Conisde one ICICI mobile app each application like -->FUnds transfer developed on java7 ,build with Maven 3 and on tomcat 7
Another application pay mobile bill-->Build with developer on on java8 ,build with Maven 3.6.2 and on tomcat 8 

SO when developed pull code from GITHUB to test server (tomcat8,java8 ) then only mobile bill application will come and Fundtransfer will as it has version compatibilty issue
SO another test server with java7 tomcat 7  should be taken and two pllications should start listening on two difrnt servers(disk space,OS,Maintencance issue)


Server ---> Virtualization --->DOcker

Server (80/90s) --> Before procuring server we have to roughly analizy disk cpu and ram... With new requiremnet its head ache to increase all again or have to take new one
Virualization --> On our laptop we have 12gb ram 1000gb HHD--> Install VM (s/w) which acts as hypervisor--->In vm u can install number of os's/w
1) Ubuntu 3gb (9gb lft),300gb HDD 2)WIndows 4gb Ram (5gb left) 400gb hdd 3)n OS installations
It will divide our computer resoures to each OS

Virtualization resolved issue of using 3 OS (3 different laptops) in single Laptop ( saved 50*3)

Disadvantages-->
 VM s/w will occupy 2gb space in our resources
 License Key paid version
 Performance reduce of Linux (system will get hanged)..--> when hits starting to our services installed on  VM's server will get crashed
In normal servers Ubuntu -->8gb, Windows -->10gb
 In VM to install package 8(gb) confiugrations and to bring Server up it will take 3hours for 1st time ..(Aws 5minutes)
 
                                                          Docker
														  
														  
  DOcker is a openplatform for developing ,shipping and running applications.Docker enables you to seperate our applications from infrastructure so you can deliver s/w quickly with Docker.
YOu can manage your infrastructure in same way you manage your applications. By taking advantage of methodolgies for shipping,testing and deploying code quickly,you can
significantly reduce the delay between writing code & running it in application...	  


Docker FIle-->
1java8
2)code java
3)version
4)files
5)Dependencies

WIll create docker files with above requirements and after bringup incase of any issue on test UAT dev will let us know comptabilty issue then we will change simple in 
Docker file..No need to change nothing in aws / maven /update etc.. Simple change in Docker file is enough

On Dell Laptop Install Ubuntu OS -->Install Dokcer thats it no Virtualization required		

In Docker Ubuntu size will be 50 to 100 MB

Server uptime will be less than 1sec

DOcker is light weighted
Backups with single command
Easy to use and performance improvement

*********************
What is the use of the docker save and docker load commands?
A Docker image can be exported as an archive via the docker save command. For example:

docker save -o <container-export-path>.tar <container-name>
The exported Docker image can then be imported to another Docker host via the docker load command:

docker load -i <container-path>.tar

Docker:

Instead of creationg 
Before hypervisor -->




Elastic Sky X Integrated

Virutalization--->
Linux containerzation concept
Batch server overview


Veritas Volume Manager


Docker--->We used to install applications on physical servers,

Docker HUB:



Docker images
docker ps -->It will show only which containers are running
docker ps -a -->It will show all container which all are running/not running


DOcker pull 
docker run & pull


Docker run -it ubuntu --->-it interactive mode

**************************************************************



sudo 
docker pull ubuntu --->It will download unbunt

Docker images --->Will display list of all images download


We will get o/p permission Denied everytime.. For resoltion

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER--->Adding ubuntu as sudo user

Change the permissions of docker socket to be able to connect to the docker
daemon /var/run/docker.sock

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

Change images to container:

docker run -it imageid --->it will take us inside of container (-it ) user 
Interactive mode (it)

docker run -it imageid-->It will create container but it wont enter inside

ctrl-pq it will exit from container without killing the session

docker ps --->to check all running containers
dockser ps -a -->to check all stopped and running containers

docker exec -it cid /bin/sh

In Above /bin/sh will have PID 1 and will get killed if we do exit from container

docker stop container cid
docker start/restart container cid
docker rm cid

to  remove running Container using docker rm cid -f

DOcker rmi image id--->To remove docker image

Inspect Node:
Docker inspect node

su ubuntu    


********************************

Runinng a webserivce in a container:

docker run -d --name newwebserver -p 8070:80 visualpath/devops-ci

we started container in background by option -d, 
Above image is apache webserver running with port 80 and is mapped to 8070. If we access hostmachine IP on port 8070 we will get service running on port 80 from containers.
COntainers are not directly accessed by IPS because container IP's are not permanent..
http://hostip:8070

******

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 5050:5050 -v /your/home/:/var/jenkins_home jenkins

Here we are mapping two ports 8080 and 5000, Host and container ports are same which is ok if ports are not busy...
COntainers dats is not persistent if we container got deleted.. If we want to keep data safe on host machine..we can use -V flag which is for volume..
Now we will always have safe data on /var/jenkins_home on host machine

**********


Dokcer files:

DOcker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a DOcker File...a text file that contains all the commands...

Create an empty directory and put file in it with name Dockerfile...

#Use of official Python runtime as a basic image

From python:2.7-slim

#set working directory to /app

WORKDIR /app

#copy the current directory contents into the container at /app

ADD ./app

#Install any needed packaged specfied in requirements.txt

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

#Make port 80 available to the world outside this container

EXPOSE 80
	
	
DOcker COmpose:

docker-compose -v (docker-compose --version) (to check version & it will be auto install with docker)

Lets say amazon have hundreds of modules like cart(webserver0) -->db, productt category -->db, wallet --->Db like that each module(webserver) with each db (different sizes)
We can create all modules with a single file called docker-compose

Tool for defining and running multicontainer docker applications
Use yaml files to configure application services (docker-compose.yml)
can start and stop all services with a single command --->docker compose up   docker compose down
Can scale up selected services when required

version: '3'

services:
 
 
 web:
   image: nginx
   ports:
   -9090:80
   
   database:
   image: redis
   
   
 docker-compose config to check above syntax is fine/not
  docker-compose up (command to execute above)
  docker-compose up -d(in detach mode)
   
   
   
   
scaling concept:
In above we have 2 different services web and database.. If we have requirement to increase 
   -scale
   docker-compose -d --scale database=4 (It will create 4databases which are like previous one)
